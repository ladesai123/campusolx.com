# CampusOlx - Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** September 20, 2025

Your privacy is a huge priority for us. We're students, just like you, and we'll treat your data with the respect it deserves. This policy explains what information we collect and why.

### 1. Information We Collect

We only collect the information needed to provide a secure and personalized experience.

*   **Account Information via Google OAuth:** To sign up, you must authorize login via your Google account. We only accept accounts ending in **`@sastra.ac.in`**.
    *   From your Google profile, we collect your **name** and your **`@sastra.ac.in` email address**.
    *   **We never see or store your password.** Your authentication is handled securely by Google.
*   **Listing Information:** The details, descriptions, and photos of the items you post for sale.
*   **Technical Information:** Like most websites, we may automatically log technical information like your IP address or browser type. We use this for anonymous analytics to see how the site is being used and to keep it secure. We do not share this with advertisers (we don't have any!).
*   **Cookies and Local Storage:** We use essential cookies for login sessions and optional analytics cookies (with your consent). You can disable non-essential cookies in your browser settings without affecting core functionality.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

*   **To Run the Service:** To display your listings under your name, allow other students to contact you, and manage your account.
*   **To Improve the Service:** We analyze usage data in an anonymous way to understand which features are popular and how we can make CampusOlx better.
*   **To Keep Things Safe:** To enforce our Terms of Service and prevent spam, fraud, and abuse.

### 3. The AI Feature and Your Data

When you use our "Auto-generate with AI" feature, the image you've uploaded is sent to a third-party AI service (like Google Gemini) to generate a description.

*   The image is used only for the purpose of generating that description.
*   We do not send any of your personal information (like your name or email) along with the image.

### 4. Who We Share Your Information With

**We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information with any third parties for marketing purposes.** That's a promise.

We only share information in these limited circumstances:
*   **Publicly:** Your first name and your listing details (photos, description, price) are public to other users of the service.
*   **With Service Providers:** Like the AI service mentioned above, or our hosting provider (e.g., Vercel). These companies are providing a service to us and are contractually obligated to protect your data.
*   **For Legal Reasons:** If required by law, we may have to disclose your information.

### 5. Your Rights and Control

You have the following rights regarding your data:

*   **Access:** Request a copy of all data we have about you
*   **Correction:** Update incorrect information in your profile or listings  
*   **Deletion:** Request complete account and data deletion (takes up to 30 days)
*   **Portability:** Export your listing data in a readable format
*   **Restriction:** Ask us to limit how we process your data
*   **Objection:** Object to data processing for legitimate interest purposes

**To exercise these rights:** Email us at campusolx.connect@gmail.com with your request. We'll respond within 7 days.

### 6. Data Retention

*   **Account Data:** We keep your account information as long as your account is active. If you request deletion, we remove your data within 30 days.
*   **Listings:** Sold or deleted listings are removed from public view immediately but may be retained for up to 90 days for safety and fraud prevention.
*   **Chat Messages:** Messages are stored for 6 months to help resolve disputes, then automatically deleted.
*   **Usage Analytics:** Anonymous usage data is retained indefinitely to improve our service.

### 7. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information. Your account's security is primarily handled by Google's secure OAuth system. You are responsible for keeping your Google account secure.

*   **Encryption:** All data transmission is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.
*   **Database Security:** User data is stored in secure, encrypted databases with access controls.
*   **Regular Updates:** We regularly update our security measures and monitor for vulnerabilities.
