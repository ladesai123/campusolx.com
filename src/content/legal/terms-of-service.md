# CampusOlx - Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** September 20, 2025

Hey there! Welcome to CampusOlx. We're excited to have you. Our goal is to create a simple, trustworthy marketplace just for the students of our campus.

By using our service, you're agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully. Think of this as the "house rules" to make sure CampusOlx stays useful and safe for everyone.

### 1. The Big Picture: What We Are (and What We Are Not)

*   **CampusOlx is a Platform:** We are a notice board or a venue that connects student buyers with student sellers.
*   **We Are Not Part of the Deal:** CampusOlx is **not involved** in the actual transaction between users. We don't handle payments, shipping, or guarantee the quality or safety of any item. The deal is strictly between you and the other student.
*   **Trust and Responsibility:** Because we are not involved, you are responsible for your own interactions. Be smart, be safe, and use good judgment when meeting or transacting with others.

### 2. Who Can Use CampusOLX?

To ensure exclusivity and safety, CampusOlx is available only to current students of SASTRA.

*   **You must sign in using a valid Google account with a `@sastra.ac.in` email address.**
*   By creating an account, you confirm that you are a current student and agree to use your official university identity on our platform.

### 3. Your Responsibilities (The "Don'ts")

To keep our community safe, you agree **not** to post content or do anything that:
*   Is illegal, like selling stolen goods, drugs, or weapons.
*   Is hateful, threatening, or harasses another person.
*   Is spammy, like posting the same ad over and over or posting advertisements for other businesses.
*   Contains false or misleading information (e.g., saying a broken phone works perfectly).
*   Infringes on someone else's intellectual property (e.g., selling pirated software).

We reserve the right to remove any listing or suspend any account that violates these rules, without warning.

### 4. Your Content (Your Listings)

*   **You Own Your Content:** You own the rights to the photos you take and the descriptions you write for your listings.
*   **Our License to Your Content:** By posting, you give us a non-exclusive, worldwide, free license to use, display, and reproduce your content (your ad) on the CampusOlx platform. This is just so we can actually show your listing to other students!
*   **The AI Helper:** We use an AI to help you generate descriptions for your items. This is just a tool. **You are responsible for reviewing and ensuring the accuracy of any AI-generated text before you post it.**

### 5. Disputes Between Users

Since we are just a platform, we cannot mediate disputes between buyers and sellers. If you have a problem with an item you bought or a transaction, you must resolve it directly with the other student.

### 6. Limitation of Liability (This is Important!)

Because CampusOlx is a free, non-profit service run by students for students, we provide it on an "as-is" basis.

**To the fullest extent permitted by law, CampusOlx (and its founder, ladesai123) will not be liable for any financial loss, damages, personal injury, or any negative outcome resulting from a transaction, a faulty product, a misleading ad, or your use of the platform in general.** Your safety and the outcome of your transactions are your own responsibility.

### 7. Changes to These Terms

We may update these terms from time to time. If we make significant changes, we'll do our best to let you know. Continuing to use the app after changes means you agree to the new terms.

### 8. Contact Us

If you have any questions about these terms, please get in touch with us at **campusolx.connect@gmail.com**.

Thanks for being part of the CampusOlx community!
